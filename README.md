# **Exoplanet Characterization and Habitability Project**

This project explores potential exoplanets by evaluating their habitability and possible characterization through the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). It utilizes data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive for necessary calculations and displays the findings through an interactive website with an integrated backend database and graphical interface for enhanced data visualization.
